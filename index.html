            Byzantine Art, architecture, paintings, and other visual arts
            produced in the Middle Ages in the Byzantine Empire (centered at
            Constantinople) and in various areas that came under its influence.
            The pictorial and architectural styles that characterized Byzantine
            art, first codified in the 6th century, persisted with remarkable
            homogeneity within the empire until its final dissolution with the
            capture of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453.

            Byzantine art is almost entirely concerned with religious
            expressions and, more specifically, with the impersonal translation
            of carefully controlled church theology into artistic terms. Its
            forms of architecture and painting grew out of these concerns and
            remained uniform and anonymous, perfected within a rigid tradition
            rather than varied according to personal whim. The result was a
            sophistication of style and a spirituality of expression rarely
            paralleled in Western art.

            Art produced in the Byzantine Empire (or eastern Roman Empire) at
            its height, a territory that spanned large swaths of the
            Mediterranean, present day Turkey, southern Spain, and Italy between
            4th and 15th centuries. As the empire’s official religion was
            Orthodox Christianity, Byzantine art was largely devotional,
            Christian art. Perhaps the best known example of Byzantine art is a
            tenth-century mosaic of the Virgin Mary in the High Sophia in
            Istanbul that demonstrates the stylized forms, sharp contours, flat
            fields of color, and very recognizable gold mosaic the period is
            known for.

          Byzantine art also flourished in a wide variety of media including
          glass mosaic, panel and wall painting, metalwork and enamel, and
          carved relief in ivory and other precious materials. Italian artists
          and many other artists around Europe started to use Byzantine style in
          their Frescos and paintings confirming that Byzantine Art was a very
          important inspiration and learning school thru Europe.

          Little sculpture was produced in the Byzantine Empire. The most
          frequent use of sculpture was in small relief carvings in ivory, used
          for book covers, reliquary boxes, and similar object. Other miniature
          arts, embroidery, gold work, and enamel work, flourished in the
          sophisticated and wealthy society of Constantinople. Manuscript
          illumination, though it could not approach the impressive effects of
          monumental painting and mosaic, was important in spreading Byzantine
          style and iconography through Europe.

          Personally, my favorite thing that the Byzantine Empire introduced to
          the world was their unique architecture that combined with their
          artistic style created beautiful architectural concepts and buildings
          that we still can admire today. The earliest Byzantine Architecture,
          though determined by the longitudinal basilica church plan developed
          in Italy, favored the extensive use of large domes and vaults.
          Circular domes, however, were not structurally or visually suited to a
          longitudinal arrangement of the walls that supported them; thus, by
          the 10th century, a radial plan, consisting of four equal vaulted arms
          proceeding from a dome over their crossing, had been adopted in most
          areas. This central radial plan was well suited to the hierarchical
          view of the universe emphasized by the Eastern Church.

            Finally, for me, the best representation of the Byzantine Empire is
            Hagia Sophia, a brilliant architectural structure built as a
            cathedral at Constantinople under the direction of the emperor
            Justinian I. It haves the recognizable byzantine architecture which
            can be seen in the circular domes and the interior it was also
            planned to be from a Byzantine quincunx church style. The interior
            it was full of Byzantine mosaics and frescoes most of them with
            religious purpose, this edification served as a cathedral for
            centuries until the conquest of Constantinople in 1453, Mehmed II
            had it repurposed as a Mosque, with the addition of a wooden minaret
            (on the exterior, a tower used for the summons to prayer), a great
            chandelier, a mihrab (niche indicating the direction of Mecca), and
            a minbar (pulpit). We have to thanks the Turkish because not many
            conquerors leave structures (especially religious structures)
            untouched, but in the case of High Sophia there were smart enough to
            leave the structure just as it was and only make changes in the
            interior. Today it still represents a very beautiful Mosque for the
            Islam religion that can be found in Turkey.
          </p>

            This represents High Sophia as it now as a Mosque, with Islamic
            symbolism in the interior and the second images represents how it
            used to look when it was used as a cathedral before the conquest,
            also there is a Christian mural that probably was covered or
            semi-destroy by Turkish following Islam.

            Influences from Byzantine architecture, particularly in religious
            buildings, can be found in diverse regions, from Egypt and Arabia to
            Russia and Romania. During the Byzantine Renaissance it was when
            culture and art flourished and artists adopted a naturalistic style
            and complex techniques from ancient Greek and Roman art, mixing them
            with Christian themes. Byzantine painting and architecture would
            have a big influence on the later painters of the Italian
            Renaissance and all over Europe.
